          FQDNNetworkPolicy specifies which Fully-Qualified Domain Names a
          workload is allowed to egress to. FQDNNetworkPolicy has no effect
          on the allowed ingress traffic.

          FQDNNetworkPolicy works additively with Kubernetes Network Policies.
          Traffic matching either a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy or a FQDNNetworkPolicy
          will be allowed to egress the workload.
